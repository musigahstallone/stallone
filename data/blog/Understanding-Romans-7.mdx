## Understanding Sin in Romans 7

Romans chapter 7 addresses the complex relationship between the law, sin, and the believer. Here's a detailed explanation of the chapter:

### Romans 7:1-6 - The Believer's Relationship to the Law

**Verses 1-3**: Paul begins by using an analogy from marriage to explain the believer's relationship to the law. He points out that the law has authority over a person only as long as they are alive. Just as a woman is bound to her husband while he lives but is free to remarry if he dies, so believers are bound to the law only until they "die" to it through Christ.

**Verses 4-6**: Paul explains that believers have died to the law through the body of Christ so that they may belong to Him who was raised from the dead. This new relationship enables them to bear fruit for God. Under the old written code, they were controlled by the sinful nature, but now, serving in the new way of the Spirit, they are freed from the law's condemnation and are able to serve God more effectively.

### Romans 7:7-13 - The Law and Sin

**Verses 7-8**: Paul anticipates a possible misunderstanding: If the law brings awareness of sin, does that make the law sinful? He strongly denies this, stating that the law is not sin; rather, it reveals sin. For example, he wouldn't have known what coveting was if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."

**Verses 9-11**: Before the law came, sin was "dead" in the sense that it was not recognized as such. When the commandment came, sin sprang to life and led to spiritual death. The law, which was intended to bring life, instead brought death because sin used the commandment to deceive and condemn.

**Verses 12-13**: Paul reaffirms that the law is holy, righteous, and good. The problem is not with the law but with sin, which uses the law to produce death in people. This underscores the sinfulness of sin, making it utterly sinful.

### Romans 7:14-25 - The Struggle with Sin

**Verses 14-17**: Paul describes the inner conflict experienced by someone who desires to follow the law but finds themselves unable to do so because of the sinful nature. He states that the law is spiritual, but he is "sold as a slave to sin." Despite his desire to do good, he ends up doing what he hates, revealing the sin living in him.

**Verses 18-20**: Paul admits that nothing good lives in his sinful nature. He desires to do what is right but cannot carry it out. This struggle shows that sin still dwells in him, even though he wants to do good.

**Verses 21-23**: Paul summarizes his internal conflict: when he wants to do good, evil is right there with him. He delights in God's law in his inner being, but another law wages war against the law of his mind and makes him a prisoner of the law of sin.

**Verses 24-25**: Paul cries out in despair, asking who will rescue him from this body of death. He immediately answers his own question: thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! While he acknowledges the ongoing struggle between the mind that serves God's law and the sinful nature that serves the law of sin, he points to Jesus as the ultimate deliverer.

### Ellen G. White's Insights on Romans 7

Ellen G. White provides additional insights into this chapter in several of her writings:

- **"The law reveals sin"**: She emphasizes that the law is essential for understanding what sin is. Without the law, there would be no knowledge of sin, and thus no need for a Savior (Steps to Christ, p. 62).
- **"The struggle with sin"**: White discusses the internal conflict between the old nature and the new nature in Christ. This struggle is a common experience for believers and underscores the need for constant reliance on Jesus (The Sanctified Life, p. 83).
- **"Victory in Christ"**: She highlights that victory over sin is possible through Jesus Christ. The believer must continually surrender to Christ and rely on His power to overcome the sinful nature (Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 144).

### Summary

Romans chapter 7 illustrates the purpose of the law in revealing sin, the believer's struggle with sin, and the ultimate victory found in Jesus Christ. It underscores the need for believers to rely not on their own strength but on the grace and power of Christ to live a righteous life.
