## Ephesians 2:10 - God's Masterpiece

Ephesians 2:10 is a profound verse that reveals our identity as God's creation and our purpose in Christ. Here's a detailed exploration of the verse:

### Ephesians 2:10 (KJV):
"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."

### Key Points and Detailed Explanation:

#### 1. **"For we are his workmanship"**

- **"Workmanship"**: The Greek word used here is "poiēma," which can be translated as "creation" or "work of art." This implies that believers are God's masterpiece, intricately and purposefully crafted by Him.
- **Implication**: This emphasizes the idea that our salvation and transformation are not our own doing but the result of God’s creative work. It speaks to the intentionality and care with which God shapes each believer.

#### 2. **"Created in Christ Jesus"**

- **"Created"**: This term indicates a new creation, echoing 2 Corinthians 5:17, which says, "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
- **"In Christ Jesus"**: This phrase signifies that this new creation and transformation occur within the context of a relationship with Christ. It's through union with Christ that believers are made new.

#### 3. **"Unto good works"**

- **Purpose**: The reason for this new creation is explicitly stated – it is for good works. Good works are not the cause of salvation but the result and evidence of it.
- **Nature of Good Works**: These works are actions and behaviors that reflect God's character and are pleasing to Him. They involve acts of love, service, compassion, and righteousness.

#### 4. **"Which God hath before ordained"**

- **Preordained Path**: God has prepared these good works in advance. This indicates that there is a divine purpose and plan for each believer's life that includes specific acts of goodness and service.
- **Providence**: This highlights God's sovereignty and foreknowledge. God has a specific plan for how each believer is to live out their faith.

#### 5. **"That we should walk in them"**

- **"Walk"**: In biblical terms, to "walk" often means to live or conduct one's life. It implies a continuous, ongoing lifestyle, not just occasional actions.
- **Living Out the Plan**: Believers are called to live daily in the good works God has prepared for them. It's a holistic call to a life characterized by ongoing faithfulness and obedience.

### Ellen G. White’s Perspective:

Ellen G. White often speaks about the purpose and role of good works in the believer's life, emphasizing that while they are not the basis of salvation, they are an essential fruit of a living faith.

- **True Faith and Works**: In "Steps to Christ," White asserts that faith and works are inseparable. Genuine faith will always manifest in acts of love and obedience (SC, p. 60-61).
- **God’s Workmanship**: In "The Acts of the Apostles," she elaborates that believers are indeed God's workmanship, created for the purpose of reflecting His character through good works. This transformation is a witness to the world of God's power (AA, p. 476-478).
- **Prepared Path**: White underscores that the path of good works is preordained by God, suggesting a divine orchestration where each believer has a unique role in God's plan, prepared specifically for them (MH, p. 509).

### Synthesis:

Ephesians 2:10 tells us that believers are God's carefully crafted masterpieces, recreated in Christ to fulfill a divine purpose through good works. These works are not incidental but are part of a preordained plan, indicating that God has a specific path of righteous living laid out for each person who is in Christ. This passage emphasizes the transformation that comes from salvation, resulting in a life that continually reflects God's love and character through actions that He has prepared in advance.

This understanding integrates the theological concepts of grace, faith, and works, demonstrating how they are interrelated in the life of a believer. It aligns with Ellen G. White’s teachings, which emphasize that true faith naturally results in a life characterized by good works, prepared and empowered by God.
