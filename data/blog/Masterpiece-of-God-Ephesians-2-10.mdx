## God's Masterpiece - Ephesians 2:10

Ephesians 2:10 provides a powerful statement about believers as God's workmanship, created for good works. Here’s a reflection on this verse:

### Ephesians 2:10 - Created for Good Works

**Verse 10**: Paul writes that we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. This verse emphasizes both the creative power of God and the purpose for which believers are created.

### Understanding "Handiwork"

The term "handiwork" or "workmanship" (Greek: _poiema_) suggests that believers are God's masterpieces. Just as an artist takes pride in their creation, God takes delight in His people, who are uniquely crafted for His purposes.

### Created in Christ Jesus

Believers are created anew in Christ Jesus, indicating a spiritual rebirth. This new creation is part of God's redemptive work, transforming individuals to reflect His image and character.

### Purpose of Good Works

The good works prepared in advance are not the basis of salvation but the result of it. Believers are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), and their good works are a demonstration of their transformed lives and God's ongoing work in them.

### Summary

Ephesians 2:10 highlights the identity and purpose of believers as God's masterpieces, created in Christ Jesus for good works. This verse calls believers to recognize their value in God’s sight and to live out their purpose by engaging in the good works God has prepared for them.
