### 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 - The Characteristics of Love

**Verses 4-7**: Paul describes the qualities of love. Love is patient, kind, not envious or boastful, not proud or rude. It is not self-seeking or easily angered and keeps no record of wrongs. Love rejoices with the truth and always protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres.

### 1 Corinthians 13:8-13 - The Permanence of Love

**Verses 8-13**: Paul states that love never fails, unlike prophecies, tongues, and knowledge, which will cease. He highlights that we know in part now but will know fully in the future. Faith, hope, and love remain, but the greatest of these is love.

### Summary
