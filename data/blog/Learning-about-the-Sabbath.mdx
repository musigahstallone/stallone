# Understanding the Sabbath: Biblical and Ellen G. White's Perspectives

The Sabbath is a cornerstone of worship in Judeo-Christian traditions, especially within Seventh-day Adventism. This article explores the Sabbath's origins, significance, effects on worshippers, and consequences of neglect, drawing from both the Bible and Ellen G. White's writings.

## The Origin of the Sabbath

The Sabbath's origin is found in the creation narrative. According to Genesis 2:2-3:

> "And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made."

This passage highlights that the Sabbath was instituted by God at the creation, setting apart the seventh day as holy.

## Significance of the Sabbath

### Biblical Significance

The Sabbath is emphasized in the Ten Commandments given to Moses. Exodus 20:8-11 states:

> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work... For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it."

The commandment underscores the Sabbath as a memorial of creation and a day of rest and worship.

### Ellen G. White's Perspective

Ellen G. White, a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, wrote extensively on the Sabbath. In her book *The Great Controversy*, she explains:

> "As the Sabbath was the sign that distinguished Israel when they came out of Egypt to enter the earthly Canaan, so it is the sign that now distinguishes God's people as they come out from the world to enter the heavenly rest."

White saw the Sabbath as a perpetual covenant between God and His people, a sign of sanctification (Ezekiel 20:12).

## Effects of Sabbath Observance

### Spiritual Renewal

Observing the Sabbath provides spiritual renewal. It is a time for believers to step back from daily toil and focus on their relationship with God. Isaiah 58:13-14 describes the blessings of Sabbath observance:

> "If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight... then you shall delight yourself in the Lord."

### Physical and Mental Rest

The Sabbath also offers physical and mental rest. In her book *The Desire of Ages*, Ellen G. White writes:

> "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. It was to benefit mankind. The Sabbath is a sign of creative and redeeming power; it points to God as the source of life and knowledge."

This rest is essential for human well-being, providing a rhythm of work and rest.

## Consequences of Neglecting the Sabbath

### Biblical Consequences

Neglecting the Sabbath was taken seriously in the Bible. In Ezekiel 20:21, God laments:

> "Notwithstanding, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and they despised My judgments... and they polluted My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them."

### Ellen G. White's Warning

Ellen G. White also warned against neglecting the Sabbath. In *Testimonies for the Church*, she wrote:

> "God is testing His people to see who will be loyal to the principles of His truth. Our work now is to awaken men and women to the importance of obedience to God’s holy law. By precept and example, we are to show them that they must come back to their allegiance."

Neglecting the Sabbath is seen as a rejection of God's authority and a step away from His covenant.

## Why Worship Only on the Sabbath?

### Biblical Mandate

The Bible specifically sets apart the seventh day as holy. Other days are not given the same designation. While worship on other days is not prohibited, the Sabbath is uniquely sanctified for rest and worship.

### Ellen G. White's Insight

Ellen G. White emphasized the importance of keeping the Sabbath distinct. In *Patriarchs and Prophets*, she wrote:

> "God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise. He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of the seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God and meditate upon His power and goodness."

White’s writings reinforce the Sabbath as a specific time appointed by God for rest and worship, distinguishing it from other days.

## Conclusion

The Sabbath is deeply rooted in biblical tradition and highlighted in the writings of Ellen G. White. It serves as a memorial of creation, a sign of sanctification, and a time for spiritual and physical rejuvenation. Observing the Sabbath aligns believers with God’s command, offering profound blessings. Neglecting it, conversely, signifies a departure from God’s covenant. While worship on other days is not inherently wrong, the Sabbath holds a unique, divinely-ordained significance that should be honored and preserved.

By embracing the Sabbath, believers reaffirm their allegiance to God and partake in the rest and renewal He intended for humanity from the very beginning.
